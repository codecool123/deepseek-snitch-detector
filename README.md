# Personality Quiz (LLaMA in-browser)

A CodeSandbox-ready app that uses LLaMA (via Transformers.js, all in-browser) to conduct a personality quiz.

## Setup

1. Import this repo into CodeSandbox or clone locally.
2. No API key required!
3. Start the app.

## How it works

- LLaMA generates questions and analyzes your answers in-browser (no server or API).
- After several rounds, it provides an indirect character analysis.
